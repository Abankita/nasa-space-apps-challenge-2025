Asteroid Impact Simulator for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

## Overview
This web application visualizes and simulates the impact of near-Earth objects (asteroids) on our planet. Users can select real asteroids or customize their own, analyze threat levels, and view recommended deflection strategies. The interactive 3D Earth model helps users understand the consequences of asteroid impacts in an engaging way.

## Features
- Real-time 3D visualization of Earth and asteroid impacts
- Select real NEOs or create custom asteroid scenarios
- Threat analysis: diameter, velocity, impact energy
- Recommended deflection strategies (Gravity Tractor, Kinetic Impactor, Nuclear Interceptor)
- Impact consequence report: seismic magnitude, crater size, air blast radius, tsunami potential

## Technologies
- JavaScript (Three.js for 3D rendering)
- HTML/CSS (responsive design)
- NASA NEO data (sample JSON)
